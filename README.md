# What Do You Wanna See
## Thanks to my teammate @zaimizem for this project.
This is a movie recommender that uses keywords. 

First you need to enter at least 5 keywords and you need to click Show Recommendation button. 
If you press ENTER button on your keyboard you can see your already entered keywords.

The whatdoyouwannasee.py file contains all the necessary codes for app.py. Also end of the code it uses cosine similarity and knn together so we can see its precision.

The app.py data is for API part. It creates a web app so we can run our app. 

The RewData.ipynb file does not have any API part. It runs on the terminal and we can control our code.
